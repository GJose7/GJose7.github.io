### CPSC 120

* Lab 4
    
    Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite because this was a pivotal point in the semester where I started understanding how to go about fixing my errors. Lab 4 part 1 was about converting any number of ml to multiple different units of measurements such as cups, teaspoons, and tablespoons. This lab I was able to write code that would do the strenuous calculations and provide us a quick easy summary in less than a second. I can build on this and have a program that helps me convert time into different units like seconds, hours, minutes, and so on. 
 
* Lab 6
    
    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite as well because it had us build an easy game of blackjack. It got a little tricky with the Ace card, however after spending some time with the code we were able to play the game like you would. This got me thinking about how game developers can use bools to keep a game running if the user is playing it. This also made me think of games like dungeons and dragons that require you to decide how to proceed and roll some dice. Depending on the roll of the dice the game will take a different route, you will either get a different story line or take damage. We have been granted the foundation on how to go about doing this by using bools and if statements.  

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 was also a favorite as it had us create a spell check on different .txt files. We did this by understanding how vectors operate and how to loop through the vectors. We created blank vectors to catch any words that were not present in the correctly spelt words vector. This was interesting as it made me realize that we take a lot of things for granted. Spell check on word document is a program that catches grammatical mistakes and now we have a fonder idea of how it operates. This lab made me question the different programs I use and get a better understanding of how it came to be, for example an inventory system that logs how much production you are holding on hand. I have a greater understanding of how to go about building something that can store that information.
